Things I still need to fix / do

- Get the results from the program and make sure that it allows live streaming of 
  results. This will be similar to what I have used to live stream the video so far.
  Subtasks:
        - Write the function on the search program end that is compatible with 
          live streaming and also makes sure that we are passing around ways to 
          access the videos without passing around the actual thing
        - make sure the server can continue to connect to the client side (web page).
          basically make sure it doesn't end until we tell it to
        - figure out a way to end the search program: 
            -Client: if the user tells us to end the program by
                 (1) closing the browser/window
                 (2) pressing some sort of esc key or button.
            -Server:
                On the server/search program side of things I was thinking that we 
                could keep track of all the results and when our program is finally 
                done we could return the best result(maybe more then one if there is a tie) 
                of all of the results. I think this is what we were planing to do but
                by making this result different from the others when I post this to 
                the server I can make the result look different from the others. In 
                order to do this I need to be able to differentiate this from the 
                other results.
- Implement error handlers to return more helpful errors to the user when 
  something wrong happens. The error can be the result of the client or the 
  server. Some examples include the user uploading a file to search for that is 
  not mp4. What happens when the server crashes (overload or exit)
