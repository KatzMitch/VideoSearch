### Instructions for testing videosearch on the EECS black-hole server

This will allow us to test the latest version of our code with a 64-core
machine.

1) SSH into the homework server.
2) > ssh black-hole.eecs.tufts.edu; enter your password.
3) > cd /data/aking09
4) > source venv/bin/activate.csh
5) cd videosearch/src
6) > git pull origin master; enter your credentials to pull the latest.
7) > time python test.py (or whatever test you'd like to run)
